\title{Downloads detailed information about clinical trials satisfying a query}
\usage{
clinicaltrials_download(query = NULL, tframe = NULL, count = 20,
  include_results = FALSE, include_textblocks = FALSE, parallel = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Search pattern as a string; a vector of key-value pairs is
interpreted as an advanced search and is therefore combined with '&'}

\item{tframe}{Data frame containing trial identifiers, as returned by
\link{clinicaltrials_search}}

\item{count}{Limit the results to a specified integer. Set to NULL to include
all results.}

\item{include_results}{Logical. Include results of completed trials.}

\item{include_textblocks}{Logical. Include lengthy text descriptions and
eligibility criteria.}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Uses parallel processing of XML files is the parallel package is installed.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. TRUE shows unzipped XML file names for debugging use. Passes to parse_study_xml.}
}
\value{
A list of \code{data.frame}s.
}
\description{
Given a query, or a dataframe containing trial identifiers, downloads
detailed study information from clinicaltrials.gov. Optionally includes
results of completed trials. The URL search is limited to 2000 characters,
and count restricted searches are done by NCT ID, which are 11 characters
long. Therefore, the effective maximum count allowed is roughly 100. If count
is greater than 100, then the first 100 trials will be returned, with a
warning. To return all results, use a query string and set count to NULL.
}
\examples{
# trials satisfying 'heart disease AND stroke AND California'
\dontrun{clinicaltrials_download(query = 'heart disease AND stroke AND California', count = 5)}

# advanced search for open, interventional trials involving melanoma
\dontrun{clinicaltrials_download(query = c('recr=Open', 'type=Intr', 'cond=melanoma'))}

# can also use a named list
\dontrun{clinicaltrials_download(query = list(recr='Open', type='Intr', cond='melanoma'))}
